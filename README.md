# CoPA Cabana - The Exascale Co-Design Center for Particle Applications Toolkit

Cabana is a performance portable library for particle-based simulations.
Applications include, but are not limited to, Molecular Dynamics (MD) with
short- and/or long-range interactions; various flavors of Particle-in-Cell
(PIC) methods, including use within fluid and solid mechanics and plasma
physics; and N-body cosmology simulations.
Cabana provides particle data structures, algorithms, and utilities to enable
simulations on a variety of platforms including many-core architectures and
GPUs.

Cabana is developed as part of the Co-Design Center for Particle Applications
(CoPA) within the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) under the U.S. Department
of Energy. CoPA is a multi-institutional project with developers from ORNL,
LANL, SNL, LLNL, PPNL, and ANL.

## Documentation

Instructions for building Cabana on various platforms, an API reference with
tutorial links, and links to the Doxygen can be found in our
[wiki](https://github.com/ECP-copa/Cabana/wiki).

For Cabana-related questions you can open a GitHub issue to interact with the
developers.
