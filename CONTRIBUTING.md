# Contributing

Contributing to Cabana is easy: just open a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). Make
`master` the destination branch on the [Cabana
repository](https://github.com/ECP-copa/Cabana) and allow edits from
maintainers in the pull request.

Your pull request must pass Cabana's tests, which includes using the coding
style from `.clang-format`, and be reviewed by at least one Cabana
developer.
