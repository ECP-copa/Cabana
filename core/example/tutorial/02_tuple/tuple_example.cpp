      Cabana tuples are similar to C++11 tuples in that they are ordered lists
      of elements of different types specified at compile time. Some aspects
      of Cabana::Tuple that are different from std::tuple:

      *: Cabana tuples must consist of data of trivial types and classes. A
         trivial type or class is one who's

         1) storage is contiguous (i.e. trivially copyable)

         2) which only supports static default initialization (trivially
            default constructible), either cv-qualified or not.

         Trivial types include scalar types, trivial classes and arrays of any
         such types. A trivial class is a class (defined with class, struct or
         union) that is both trivially default constructible and trivially
         copyable, which implies that:

         1) uses the implicitly defined default copy and move constructors,
            copy and move assignments, and destructor

         2) has no virtual members

         3) has no non-static data members with brace- or equal- initializers

         4) its base class and non-static data members (if any) are themselves
            also trivial types

      *: The types in a Cabana tuple are defined via a type parameter
         pack using the Cabana::MemberTypes class

      *: Cabana tuples are designed to store and access multidimensional array
         data with accessors provided to obtain references to individual array
         values within the tuple.
    */

    /* Start by declaring the types in our tuple will store. Store a rank-2
       array of doubles, a rank-1 array of floats, and a single integer in
       each tuple.

    */
