      A linked cell list is a data structure which bins particles based on the
      Cartesian grid cell in which they are located. An input uniform
      Cartesian grid description is used to locate which particles, defined by
      an input slice of 3D Cartesian coordinates, are located in which grid
      cells.

      The result of creating this data structure is binning data which may
      then be used to reorder the data in an AoSoA in identical fashion to the
      sorting and binning example we just completed. In effect, a linked cell
      list is simply a more sophisticated form of binning which uses a custom
      comparator for particles based on their spatial location relative to a
      uniform Cartesian grid.
