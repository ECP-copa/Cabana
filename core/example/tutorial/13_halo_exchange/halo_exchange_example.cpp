void haloExchangeExample()

    /*
      The halo is a communication plan designed from halo exchange where some
      locally-owned elements on each rank are used as ghost data on other
      ranks. The halo supplies both forward and reverse communication
      operations. In the forward operation (the gather), data is sent from the
      uniquely-owned decomposition to the ghosted decomposition. In the
      reverse operation (the scatter), data is sent from the ghosted
      decomposition back to the uniquely-owned decomposition and collisions
      are resolved.

      In this example we will demonstrate building a halo communication
      plan and performing both scatter and gather operations.

      Note: The halo uses MPI for data movement. MPI is initialized
      and finalized in the main function below.

      Note: The halo uses GPU-aware MPI communication. If AoSoA data is
      allocated in GPU memory, this feature will be used automatically.

      next/previous rank so use that information in this case because this
      substantially reduces the amount of communication needed to compose the

      from our neighbor so the new size should be 110 in this case.

      The halo always puts the ghost data at the end of the aosoa. In this

      10 are the ghosts we got from our neighbor. If there are multiple ranks

      into the locally-owned value. Because of the nature of the scatter, it
      can only be performed with slices and not the entire AoSoA.

      Elements 90-99 will now have their original values plus the values they
