    /*
      Slices are a mechanism to access a tuple member across all tuples in an
      AoSoA as if it were one large multidimensional array. In this basic
      example we will demonstrate the way in which a user can generate a slice
      and access it's data.

      Slices, like the AoSoA from which they are derived, can be accessed via
      1-dimensional and 2-dimensional indices with the latter exposing
      vectorizable loops over the inner elements of each SoA in the data
      structure.

      A slice does not copy the AoSoA data - rather it simply points to the
      data as an unmanaged shallow copy. Because there is no reference
      counting associated with a slice, the user must take care not to delete
      the AoSoA from which the slice is derived before they are done using the
      slice. In addition, if the slice memory is changed in any way (i.e. from
      resizing, changing the capacity, or any other types of changes to the
      allocation) the slice is no longer valid and must be recreated from the
      new AoSoA data.
    */

    /*
       Start by declaring the types our tuples will store. Store a rank-2
       array of doubles, a rank-1 array of floats, and a single integer in
       each tuple.

      allocates memory in standard CPU RAM.

      Kokkos also supports execution on NVIDIA GPUs. To create an AoSoA
      allocated with CUDA Unified Virtual Memory (UVM) use
      `Kokkos::CudaUVMSpace` instead of `Kokkos::HostSpace`. The CudaUVMSpace
      allocates memory in managed GPU memory via `cudaMallocManaged`. This

      space as the AoSoA from which it was derived. Slices may optionally be
