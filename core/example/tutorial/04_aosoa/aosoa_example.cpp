    /*
      Cabana array-of-structs-of-arrays (AoSoAs) is simply a list of Cabana
      SoAs. A Cabana AoSoA provides a convenient interface to create a
      manipulate these lists. In addition to needing a definition of the tuple
      types using Cabana::MemberTypes as well as defining the vector length
      for the SoAs, we now also need to declare where we want this list of
      SoAs allocated.

      In Cabana we do this with memory spaces (if you are familiar with Kokkos
      memory spaces we borrow directly from their concept). A memory space
      simply indicates what type of function is used to allocate and free memory
      (e.g. malloc() and free() or cudaMalloc() and cudaFree()). Depending on
      the type of memory space used the AoSoA data can be used with different
      types of accelerators or programming models.
    */

       Start by declaring the types in our tuples will store. Store a rank-2
       array of doubles, a rank-1 array of floats, and a single integer in
       each tuple.

      Next declare the vector length of our SoAs. This is how many tuples the
      SoAs will contain. A reasonable number for performance should be some
      multiple of the vector length on the machine you are using.

    /*
      Finally declare the memory space in which the AoSoA will be allocated
      and the execution space in which kernels will execute. In this example
      we are writing basic loops that will execute on the CPU. The HostSpace
      allocates memory in standard CPU RAM.

      Kokkos also supports execution on NVIDIA GPUs. For example, to create an
      AoSoA allocated with CUDA Unified Virtual Memory (UVM) use
      `Kokkos::CudaUVMSpace` instead of `Kokkos::HostSpace`. The CudaUVMSpace
      allocates memory in managed GPU memory via `cudaMallocManaged`. This
      memory is automatically paged between host and device depending on the
      context in which the memory is accessed.
