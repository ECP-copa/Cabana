      Create the Verlet list. We will only consider a particle to be a
      neighbor if it is within the specified radius. We will make this radius
      small enough so that only the particles that share cells will be found
      as neighbors.

      This variation of the Verlet list uses a background grid to accelerate
      the searching. The user must provide the minimum and maximum bounds of
      this grid and the ratio between the size of the cells in this grid and
      the neighborhood radius.

      This cell ratio parameter can be used to tweak performance. Larger cell
      ratios will give larger cells meaning more particles in each cell while
      a smaller cell ratio will give smaller cells and less particles in each
      cell.

      We also need to specify whether or not we want to build a full neighbor
      list or a half neighbor list.

          *: Full neighbor lists store all neighbors for all particles. This
             is specified by the Cabana::FullNeighborTag algorithm tag.

          *: Half neighbor lists only store a particle-particle neighbor pair
             once. If particle `i` is a neighbor of particle `j` then particle
             `i` will be listed as having 1 neighbor with index `j`. Particle
             `j` will be listed as having no neighbors as its relationship to
             `i` is implied. This is specified by the Cabana::HalfNeighborTag
             algorithm tag.

       We will build a full neighbor list in this example. As an exercise, try
       changing the list algorithm tag to a half neighbor list and look at the
       difference in the output.
