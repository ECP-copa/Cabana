  \brief A communication plan for scattering and gathering of ghosted data.

  \tparam MemorySpace Kokkos memory space in which data for this class will be
  allocated.

  The halo allows for scatter and gather operations between locally-owned and
  ghosted data. All data in the Halo (e.g. export and import data) is from the
  point of view of the forward *GATHER* operation such that, for example, the
  number of exports is the number of exports in the gather and the number of
  imports is the number of imports in the gather. The reverse *SCATTER*
  operation sends the ghosted data back the the uniquely-owned decomposition
  and resolves collisions. Based on input for the forward communication plan
  (where local data will be sent) the local number of ghosts is computed. Some
  nomenclature:

  Export - the local data we uniquely own that we will send to other ranks for
  those ranks to be used as ghosts. Export is used in the context of the
  forward communication plan (the gather).

  Import - the ghost data that we get from other ranks. The rank we get a
  ghost from is the unique owner of that data. Import is used in the context
  of the forward communication plan (the gather).
